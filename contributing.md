## Contributing to this list

Please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines.

- The pull request contains a fix a or new item rather than a duplicate
  of an existing one.
  (Go through the list carefully to verify that the item you're submitting
  is actually a new one.)
- The item you're submitting must be an openly available
  [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer)ful
  web service or a list of such services.
  Openly available means that the service should be directly accessible
  over the global web, without requiring prior registration.
  (It is OK if the service imposes rate limits.)
- The service must be of general interest, i.e. potentially useful to tens
  of thousands of people.
  For example, a REST service providing the air quality of a major metropolis
  is of general interest, whereas one giving the daily menu of a local
  restaurant isn't.
- Each entry is provided through a descriptive title linking to the service's
  documentation, followed by a link named "example" demonstrating a
  representative example of the service's use.
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
- Use the following format for web services:
  `[Web service name](documentation link) - Description; [example](link)`.
- Where possible, the example should yield results in JSON or plain text,
  which are easily readable in modern browsers.
- Use the following format for lists of related (e.g. geolocation) web services:
  `[List name](link) - Description`.
- Do not add lists of unrelated web services.
- Do not start the description with *A* or *An*.
- Maintain alphabetic ordering when adding items.
- New categories or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome.
- Maintain alphabetic ordering in the categories.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.
- The pull request and commit should have a useful title.

Thank you for your contributions!

## Updating your Pull Request

Sometimes, a maintainer of an awesome list will ask you to edit your Pull Request before it is included. This is normally due to spelling errors or because your PR didn't match the awesome-* list guidelines.

[Here](https://github.com/RichardLitt/docs/blob/master/amending-a-commit-guide.md) is a write up on how to change a Pull Request, and the different ways you can do that.
